# Blockchain Case Study
## CASE STUDY: Stellar
# What is it?
Stellar is an open-source network for currencies and payments. Stellar makes it possible to create, send and trade digital representations of all forms of money.
Stellar users can make instant cross-border money transfers in any currency. It takes only 2-5 seconds to process a transaction, and a very low commission cost makes the platform a great tool for micropayments. In 2014, Jed McCaleb who is one of the co-founder of the Ripple project alongside Joyce Kim a former lawyer, launched the network system Stellar. Since then it’s processed more than 450 million operations made by over 4 million individual accounts. Large enterprise companies and companies as small as single-dev startups have chosen Stellar to move money and access new markets. The Stellar network has a native digital currency, the lumen, that’s required in small amounts for initializing accounts and making transactions.

# What is Stellar trying to solve?
From when Stellar was launched in 2014, it has been designed as a cryptocurrency-adjacent, but the software has always been intended to enhance rather than undermine or replace the existing financial system. In comparison, the Bitcoin network was made and is seen for trading only bitcoins and to be somewhat as an alternative to the traditional financial system, Stellar is a decentralized system that’s great for trading any kind of money in a transparent and efficient way, designed to compliment the traditional finance system and provide an alternative means to transact with money in a more cost effective, fast and secure way.

# Impact of the Stellar Project
Stellars main impact globally is creating a means to facilitate cross border transactions, at a low cost and in a quick timeframe, there are other cryptocurrency based projects that aim to do the same such as Ripple (XRP) and that is why one of the main impacts in the cryptocurrency market Stellar has had is its competition with Ripple. 

Some similarities between the two crypto currencies are:
1. Both have private nodes without mining allowed;
2. Both rely on distributed ledger technology;
3. Deliver almost free and instant transactions, making them ideal for international payments and transfers.

# Road Map and Goals
As found on the Stellar website, the project has a few main goals in order for it to become a widely used project to facilitate transactions within the financial industry. These goals include:

- Support the robustness and usability of Stellar; 
- Help Stellar be the blockchain people know and trust; and 
- Foster and develop sustainable Stellar use cases for cross-border payments and securitized assets.

Right now the stellar project is mostly focussed on development of technology, ecosystem, policy, brand, and use-case development.
